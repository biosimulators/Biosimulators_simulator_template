# Template repository for a Dockerfile for building a Docker image for a BioSimulations-compliant simulator

This repository provides a template for a Dockerfile for building a BioSimulations-compliant Docker image for a simulation software program, as well as documentation about the interface that containerized simulators must implement and examples for testing a containerized simulator.

This repository is intended for simulation software developers. We recommend that end users utilize containerized simulators through the web-based graphical interface at https://biosimulations.dev.

## Building a Docker image for a simulator using this template
1. Install the [Docker engine](https://www.docker.com/).

2. Fork this repository.

3. Create a BioSimulations-compliant command-line interface to your simulator.

   The interface should accept two keyword arguments:

   - `-i`, `--archive`: A path to a COMBINE archive which contains descriptions of one or more simulation tasks.
   - `-o`, `--out-dir`: A path to a directory where the outputs of the simulation tasks should be saved. Reports should be saved in CSV format and plots should be saved in PDF format. The simulator should create a directory to contain the output of each SED-ML document. This should have the same path relative to the top-level output directory as the SED-ML file to the root of the archive. The file name of each output should be the id of the output plus the one of the extensions `.csv` or `.pdf`.

   In addition, we recommend providing handlers for reporting help and version information about the command-line interface to your simulator:

   - `-h`, `--help`: This argument should instruct the command-line program to print help information about itself.
   - `-v`, `--version`: This argument should instruct the command-line program to report version information about itself.

   This repository contains sample code for using Python and [cement](https://builtoncement.com/) to create a BioSimulations-compliant command-line interface for a simulator. This code is located at `my_simulator/__main__.py`. To follow this example, 

   1. Rename the `my_simulator` directory.
   2. Edit the name, URL of the simulator in `my_simulator/__main__.py`.
   3. Implement the `exec_combine_archive` method in `my_simulator/core.py`. [`Biosimulations_utils`](https://reproducible-biomedical-modeling.github.io/Biosimulations_utils) provides several utilities methods and data structures for parsing COMBINE archives and SED-ML documents; representing archives and simulation experiments; and orchestrating the execution of all of the tasks in a simulation experiment. These utility methods make it easy for developers to handle COMBINE-encoded archives and SED-ML-encoded simulation experiments.

   This code will produce a command-line interface similar to that below:
   ```
   usage: <my-simulator> [-h] [-d] [-q] -i ARCHIVE [-o OUT_DIR] [-v]

   BioSimulations-compliant command-line interface to the <MySimulator> simulation program <http://url.to.my.simulator>.

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     -d, --debug           full application debug mode
     -q, --quiet           suppress all console output
     -i ARCHIVE, --archive ARCHIVE
                           Path to OMEX file which contains one or more SED-ML-
                           encoded simulation experiments
     -o OUT_DIR, --out-dir OUT_DIR
                           Directory to save outputs
     -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
   ```

4. Optionally, package the command-line interface for easy distribution and installation.

   This repository contains sample files for packaging the sample Python-based command-line interface for distribution via [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/) and installation via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

   - `my_simulator/_version.py`: Set the `__version__` attribute to the version of your simulator.
   - `setup.py`: Edit the installation script for the command-line interface to your simulator.   
   - `requirements.txt`: Edit the list of the requirements of the command-line interface to your simulator.
   - `MANIFEST.in`: Edit the list of additional files that should be distributed with the command-line interface to your simulator.
   - `setup.cfg`: Wheel configuration for distributing the command-line interface to your simulator. For most command-line interfaces, this file doesn't need to be edited.

5. Create a Dockerfile for building a Docker image for the command-line interface to your simulator. [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) contains a template Dockerfile for a command-line interface implemented with Python.

   - Additional files that need to be copied into the image can be saved to a directory such as `assets/`.
   - In most cases, commercial licenses needed to run the image should be injected at runtime. Please contact the [BioSimulations team](info@reproduciblebiomodels.org) to discuss your needs.
   - Use BioContainers-style labels to capture metadata about the image. See the [BioContainers documentation](https://biocontainers-edu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_biocontainers.html#create-a-dockerfile-recipe) for more information.
     ```
     LABEL base_image="ubuntu:18.04"
     LABEL version="1.0.0"
     LABEL software="BioNetGen"
     LABEL software.version="2.5.0"
     LABEL about.summary="Open-source software package for rule-based modeling of complex biochemical systems"
     LABEL about.home="https://bionetgen.org/"
     LABEL about.documentation="https://bionetgen.org/"
     LABEL about.license_file="https://github.com/RuleWorld/bionetgen/blob/master/LICENSE"
     LABEL about.license="SPDX:MIT"
     LABEL about.tags="rule-based modeling,kinetic modeling,dynamical simulation,systems biology,BNGL,SED-ML,COMBINE,OMEX"
     LABEL extra.identifiers.biotools="bionetgen"
     LABEL maintainer="Jonathan Karr <karr@mssm.edu>"
     ```

6. Build the Docker image for the command-line interface to your simulator. For example, run the following command:
   ```
   docker build \
     --tag <owner>/<my_simulator>:<version> \
     --tag <owner>/<my_simulator>:latest \
     .
   ```
7. Push the Docker image to DockerHub. For example, run the following command:
   ```
   docker login
   docker push <owner>/<my_simulator>
   ```

8. Enter metadata about your simulator into [`properties.json`](properties.json). This should include the attributes listed below. Attributes marked with `*` are optional. The schema is available in the `Schemas` >> `Simulator` section at https://api.biosimulations.dev/docs/.
  - `id`: A unique id for the simulator (e.g., `tellurium`). The id must begin with a letter or underscore and include only letters, numbers, and underscores.

  As necessary, [request additional SED-ML URNs for model formats](https://github.com/SED-ML/sed-ml/issues), [request additional COMBINE specification URLs for model formats](https://github.com/sbmlteam/libCombine/issues), and [request additional KiSAO terms for algorithm parameters](https://sourceforge.net/p/kisao/feature-requests/new/).

9. Implement tests for the command-line interface to your simulator in the `tests` directory. At a minimum, this should include a test that uses the BioSimulations simulator validator ([`Biosimulations_utils.simulator.testing.SbmlSedmlCombineSimulatorValidator`](https://reproducible-biomedical-modeling.github.io/Biosimulations_utils/html/source/Biosimulations_format_utils.simulator.html)).

   `tests/test_all.py` contains an example for testing a command-line interface implemented in Python to a simulator that supports SBML-encoded kinetic models. The `test_validator` method illustrates how to use the BioSimulations simulator validator. Example files needed for the tests can be saved to `tests/fixtures/`. `tests/requirements.txt` contains a list of the dependencies of these tests.

10. Replace this file (`README.md`) with `README.template.md` and fill out the template with information about your simulator.

11. Enter the name of the owner of your simulator and the year into the MIT License template at [`LICENSE.template`](LICENSE) and rename the template to `LICENSE`, or copy your license into `LICENSE`. We recommend using a permissive license such as the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

12. Optionally, distribute the command-line interface to your simulator. For example, the following commands can be used to distribute a command-line interface implemented with Python via [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/).
    ```
    # Convert README to RST format
    pandoc --to rst --output README.rst README.md

    # Package command-line interface
    python3 setup.py sdist
    python3 setup.py bdist_wheel

    # Install twine to upload packages to PyPI
    pip3 install twine

    # Upload packages to PyPI
    twine dist/*
    ```

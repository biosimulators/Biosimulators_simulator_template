{ my-simulator } documentation
=====================================

{ my-simulator } provides a `BioSimulators <https://biosimulators.org>`_-compliant command-line interface for { simulation-capabilities-of-my-simulator }. A Docker image for this package is also available.

This command-line interface and Docker image enable users to execute `COMBINE/OMEX archives <https://combinearchive.org/>`_ that describe one or more simulation experiments (in `SED-ML format <https://sed-ml.org>`_) of one or more models (in `{ supported-model-format } <{ url-for-supported-model-format }>`_).

A list of the algorithms and algorithm parameters supported by { my-simulator } is available at `BioSimulators <https://biosimulators.org/simulators/{ my-simulator }>`_.

A simple web application and web service for using { my-simulator } to execute COMBINE/OMEX archives is also available at `runBioSimulations <https://run.biosimulations.org>`_.
